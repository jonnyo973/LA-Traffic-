# LA-Traffic-
This project was my first python project, Our team took a look at LA traffic, we used a kaggle data set which consisted of 3 CSV files. We wanted to take an in depth look at LA traffic and use as many visuals as possible, We also used Beautiful soup to parse some titles of how bad LA traffic is, and used the twitter api to pull some tweets of how bad LA traffic really is. 
The data set link is https://www.kaggle.com/cityofLA/los-angeles-traffic-collision-data
